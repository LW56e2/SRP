# SRP-Building-Height-Project
The Python implementation for the SRP Building Height Project audio processing scripts.

## Usage
To collect RMS data from trials, run 
`python listener.py` 
with the desired input specified by INPUT_DEVICE_INDEX.

Then, to plot the RMS over time plots, run
`python analyzer.py [data_directory]`
with data_directory specifying the directory with .csv log files generated by `listener.py`.

Finally, to model the relationship, run
`python modeling.py`
and manually input the data into the `d, y` lists for the known-distance trials' distance and peak RMS values. Also, put the max RMS value of the unknown-distance trials in the `bh` list. This pipeline will be optimized in the future to avoid manual entry. 


## Data
The data of all trials including the CSV files with timestamped RMS data and the WAV files containing the raw audio can be found in the data directory.
